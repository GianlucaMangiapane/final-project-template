# MUSA 611 - Final Project Proposal
## Geo-Spatial Application of Fashion Sustainability   
Fashion and sustainability seem to be a contradictoring combination. Fashion, from the haute couture of the runways to the mass offerings of retail stores, changes constantly due to seasonal trends. Its an aspect of our culture where the individual tastes of art and the necessity of utility combine for daily wear. 

Sustainability seeks to ensure longevity and constant use, so how can it play a role in fashion? How can new fashion and trends exist in combination with re-use and reduce mentality? Consumer behavior has often been the blame and one of the causes of climate change, and yet consumerism drives fashion. 

Perhaps nowhere does fashion matter most than in a city. Walking the streets is the perpetual runway, and the flow of people passing by the constant audience. And when it comes to the city of fashion, aurguably Paris is the queen. 


This project will investigate the PARIS GOOD FASHION sustainability plan, that seeks to make Paris the global sustainablity fashion capital by 2024. 
[Paris Good Fashion]

There are 12 main workshops of the plan so far,
- [#1 Paris : Map of Sustainable Fashion] 
- [#2 How to Produce Sustainable Fashion Events]
- [#3 International Mobilization of Designers]
- [#4 Animal welfare]
- [#5 Tech for good]
- [#6 Regenerative Agriculture]
- [#7 Glossary & Common Standards]
- [#8 Hangers & Polybags]
- [#9 Reusable Packaging]
- [#10 Transparency & Traceability]
- [#11 Collect & Recycle Shoes]
- [#12 Green Store Challenge]

## Application for the Project

 I am interested in replicating the first workshop, which spatially maps sustainable brands, clothing repair shops, reclycling, etc, in a mapping and drop down application for the city of Paris. I would like to focus my project on another fashion centered city, thinking of, 
 - New York City, NY 
- Los Angeles, CA 
- Toronto, ON, Canada  
 
 I want to structure my project as applying a fashion sustainability plan specific for that city, using the Paris Good Fashion plan as a model. I wan to critique the plan, and see areas of improvement or adaptabilty for another city. Ideally the end goal will be something similar to Paris Good Fashion, but for a different fashion city. I want to make a framework that can help policymakers worth with designer to make a more sustainable creative culture, in a city that embraces those ideals.
